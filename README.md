# Tic Tac Toe Game
The Tic Tac Toe Game is a simple mobile application developed using React Native. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (X or O). The first player to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.
